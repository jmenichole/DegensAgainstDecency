## 🚀 Deployment

Choose your preferred deployment platform - all support WebSockets and real-time multiplayer:

### 🛫 Fly.io (Recommended for Discord Bot)

Fly.io provides excellent always-on hosting with great WebSocket support, perfect for running the Discord bot.

Quick start:
1. Install Fly CLI: `curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh`
2. Login: `flyctl auth login`
3. Deploy: `flyctl launch` (follow prompts)
4. **Set Discord Bot Token** (REQUIRED for bot to come online):
   ```bash
   flyctl secrets set DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
   flyctl secrets set SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
   flyctl secrets set NODE_ENV=production
   ```
5. For Supabase integration (optional):
   ```bash
   flyctl secrets set SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   flyctl secrets set SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
   flyctl secrets set SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
   ```
6. Redeploy: `flyctl deploy`

**Important**: The Discord bot will only come online if `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` is set. Get your token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) → Your Application → Bot → Token.

### 🚂 Railway (Recommended for Free Tier)

Railway offers the best free tier with always-on instances and full WebSocket support.

1. Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app) and sign in with GitHub
2. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Select this repository
4. Add environment variables (at minimum: `NODE_ENV=production`, `SESSION_SECRET`)
5. Deploy! Your app will be live at `https://your-app.railway.app`

### 🎨 Render (Great Free Tier)

Render provides a generous free tier (with cold starts after 15min inactivity).

**[📖 See detailed Render deployment guide](DEPLOYMENT_RENDER.md)**

Quick start:
1. Visit [render.com](https://render.com) and sign up with GitHub
2. Click "New +" → "Web Service"
3. Connect repository: `jmenichole/DegensAgainstDecency`
4. Configure: Build `npm install`, Start `npm start`
5. Add environment variables and deploy!

### ⚡ Vercel (Alternative Option)

Vercel works great but note that WebSocket support has some limitations.

**[📖 See detailed Vercel deployment guide](DEPLOYMENT_VERCEL.md)**

Quick start:
1. Fork/clone this repository to your GitHub account
2. Visit [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" and import this repository
4. Add environment variables in Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
   - **Required**: `NODE_ENV=production`, `SESSION_SECRET` (generate with: `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"`)
   - **Optional**: Discord OAuth credentials, OpenAI API key, etc.
5. Deploy!
6. Update Discord OAuth redirect URI to match your Vercel domain

**Important**: Environment variables must be configured in Vercel Dashboard after initial deployment. See [DEPLOYMENT_VERCEL.md](DEPLOYMENT_VERCEL.md) for complete setup instructions.

### Other Deployment Options

The app also works on:
- **Heroku**: Add Procfile with `web: node server.js`
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**: Configure as Node.js app
- **Traditional VPS**: Use PM2 process manager with nginx reverse proxy

### Environment Variables (All Platforms)

**Required:**
```env
NODE_ENV=production
SESSION_SECRET=<generate-with-crypto-randomBytes>
```

**Optional (Discord features):**
```env
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_discord_client_id
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=your_discord_client_secret
DISCORD_CALLBACK_URL=https://yourdomain.com/auth/discord/callback
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
```

**Optional (AI features):**
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

Generate `SESSION_SECRET` with: `npm run generate-secret`

### Important Notes for Production

⚠️ **Discord OAuth is optional** - The app works in guest mode without Discord authentication

⚠️ **WebSocket Support** - Railway and Render have excellent WebSocket support. Vercel has some limitations for WebSockets.

⚠️ **Session Storage** - For production at scale, use Redis for session storage instead of in-memory sessions

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Login/Signup Issues

**Problem**: Can't login or signup  
**Solutions**:
1. **Check if Discord OAuth is configured**
   - The app works in guest mode without Discord OAuth
   - Visit `/arena` directly to use guest mode
   - If Discord OAuth fails, check your environment variables

2. **Verify Discord Application Setup**
   - Ensure `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` and `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` are set
   - Confirm redirect URI matches your deployment URL
   - Check that your Discord app has the correct OAuth scopes

3. **Session Secret**
   - Make sure `SESSION_SECRET` is set in environment variables
   - Generate a secure secret for production

### API Errors

**Problem**: "Failed to create game" or "Failed to retrieve games"  
**Solutions**:
1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify the server is running (check Vercel logs or server logs)
3. Ensure all required environment variables are set
4. Try refreshing the page and clearing browser cache

### Connection Issues

**Problem**: "Unable to connect to server" or WebSocket failures  
**Solutions**:
1. **On Vercel**: WebSocket support is limited, consider alternative hosting
2. **Check CORS**: Ensure your deployment allows WebSocket connections
3. **Firewall**: Check if WebSocket ports are blocked
4. **Browser Console**: Look for specific connection errors

### Build/Deployment Issues

**Problem**: Build fails or app doesn't start  
**Solutions**:
1. Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are installed
2. Run `npm run build` locally to test
3. Check Node.js version (requires 16+)
4. Review Vercel build logs for specific errors
5. Ensure `vercel.json` is present in repository root

### Guest Mode Not Working

**Problem**: Can't access app without Discord login  
**Solutions**:
1. Navigate directly to `/arena` instead of home page
2. Check that `NODE_ENV` is properly set
3. Clear browser cookies and try again
4. Check server logs for authentication errors
