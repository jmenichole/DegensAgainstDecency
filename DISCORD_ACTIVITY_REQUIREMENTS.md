# Discord Activity Requirements

This document lists all requirements needed to run Degens Against Decency as a Discord Activity (embedded app within Discord).

## Current Status

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Discord Activities are NOT currently implemented for this application.**

As documented in [DISCORD_ACTIVITIES.md](DISCORD_ACTIVITIES.md), the development team has decided to maintain the current text-based Discord bot implementation rather than implementing Discord Activities at this time. This was a strategic decision based on:

- Broader accessibility (works in any channel, not just voice channels)
- Lower development complexity
- Faster time to market
- Better support for asynchronous gameplay

**This document outlines what WOULD BE required if Discord Activities were to be implemented in the future.**

---

## What are Discord Activities?

Discord Activities (formerly Embedded App SDK) allow developers to create interactive applications that run directly within Discord voice channels. They provide:

- Rich HTML5 canvas/iframe embedded in Discord
- Synchronized state across participants
- Integration with Discord voice channels
- Native Discord UI integration
- Cross-platform support (Desktop and Mobile Discord apps)

**Key Limitation:** Users must be in a voice channel to participate in Discord Activities.

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend Changes Needed

#### 1. Discord SDK Integration
```javascript
// Initialize Discord SDK
import { DiscordSDK } from "@discord/embedded-app-sdk";

const discordSdk = new DiscordSDK(process.env.DISCORD_CLIENT_ID);

// Authenticate user
await discordSdk.ready();
const { code } = await discordSdk.commands.authorize({
  client_id: process.env.DISCORD_CLIENT_ID,
  response_type: "code",
  state: "",
  prompt: "none",
  scope: ["identify", "guilds", "rpc.activities.write"]
});

// Exchange code for access token
const response = await fetch('/api/discord-activity/token', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ code })
});
```

#### 2. Activity UI Adaptation
- Redesign UI for Discord's embedded iframe constraints
- Optimize for Activity canvas size (typically 1280x720 or responsive)
- Remove Discord OAuth login flow (handled by SDK)
- Add voice channel participant indicators
- Implement Discord's native UI patterns

#### 3. State Synchronization
```javascript
// Sync game state with Discord Activity participants
discordSdk.commands.setActivity({
  activity: {
    type: 5, // PLAYING
    details: "Playing Degens Against Decency",
    state: "In Game",
    party: {
      id: gameId,
      size: [currentPlayers, maxPlayers]
    }
  }
});
```

### Backend Changes Needed

#### 1. Activity Authentication Endpoint
```javascript
// POST /api/discord-activity/token
// Exchange Activity authorization code for access token
router.post('/discord-activity/token', async (req, res) => {
  const { code } = req.body;
  // Exchange with Discord API
  // Validate and return access token
});
```

#### 2. Activity Instance Management
- Track Activity instances (one per voice channel)
- Manage participant join/leave events
- Synchronize state across Activity instance
- Handle Activity lifecycle (create, update, destroy)

#### 3. Activity-Specific WebSocket Events
```javascript
// Additional WebSocket events for Activity
socket.on('activity-join', (data) => {
  // Handle user joining from Activity
});

socket.on('activity-participant-update', (data) => {
  // Handle participant list changes in voice channel
});

socket.on('activity-instance-create', (data) => {
  // Create new Activity instance for voice channel
});
```

## Alternative: Hybrid Approach

### Recommended Strategy

Instead of full Discord Activity implementation, consider:

1. **Keep Current Discord Bot** (Text-based with slash commands)
   - Works in any channel
   - Lower complexity
   - Broader accessibility
   - Already implemented

2. **Keep Standalone Web App** (For rich UI experience)
   - Full control over features
   - No Discord limitations
   - Better for new users
   - Already implemented

3. **Add Discord Activity Later** (Optional premium feature)
   - Post-v1.0 enhancement
   - For users who want embedded experience
   - Voice channel focused gameplay
   - Requires significant resources

### Benefits of Hybrid Approach
✅ Faster time to market
✅ Lower development cost
✅ Broader user reach
✅ Easier maintenance
✅ Multiple access points
✅ Better user choice

## Why Discord Activities Are NOT Currently Implemented

As detailed in [DISCORD_ACTIVITIES.md](DISCORD_ACTIVITIES.md):

### Disadvantages That Led to Decision
1. **User Limitations**: Requires voice channel participation
2. **Development Complexity**: Significantly more complex than current implementation
3. **Approval Process**: Requires Discord review and ongoing compliance
4. **Accessibility**: Excludes text-only and async players
5. **Deployment Constraints**: Stricter hosting requirements
6. **Maintenance Burden**: Additional SDK updates and API changes

### Current Implementation Advantages
1. **Works Everywhere**: Any Discord channel, any time
2. **Text-Based**: DM-based private cards maintain game integrity
3. **Async Support**: Players can take turns on their schedule
4. **Web Option**: Rich UI available via website
5. **Simpler**: Easier to develop, test, and maintain

---

## Conclusion

**Discord Activities are a future enhancement option, not a current requirement.**

The current implementation provides:
- ✅ Full Discord integration via bot and slash commands
- ✅ Rich UI experience via standalone website
- ✅ Proper game functionality and privacy
- ✅ Broader accessibility
- ✅ Easier deployment and maintenance

**If implementing Discord Activities in the future:**
- Budget 3-4 months development time
- Prepare for Discord approval process
- Ensure adequate hosting infrastructure
- Plan for ongoing maintenance

**For now, focus on:**
- Website deployment (see [WEBSITE_REQUIREMENTS.md](WEBSITE_REQUIREMENTS.md))
- Discord bot features (already implemented)
- User acquisition and feedback
